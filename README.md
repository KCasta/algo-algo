# Sum Up Three Numbers Algorithm

## Description

This algorithm reads three integer numbers, calculates their sum, and adds 20 to the sum if it is less than 10. The final sum is then output.

## Algorithm

1. Read three integer numbers.
2. Calculate the sum of these three numbers.
3. If the sum is less than 10, add 20 to the sum.
4. Output the final sum.
